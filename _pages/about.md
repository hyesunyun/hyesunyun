Hello!

My name is Hye Sun Yun (윤혜선 in Korean).

I am a Computer Science PhD student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) in the [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/).
I work on **Human-Computer Interactions (HCI)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, mainly on applications in health. I am co-advised by [Timothy Bickmore](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/bickmore/) and [Byron Wallace](https://www.byronwallace.com/).
I am interested in applying HCI methods to the design and development of NLP models that meets the needs, interests, preferences, and requirements of the users. I love collaborating with diverse domain experts in multi/interdisciplinary projects tackling real-world problems.

Before starting my PhD in fall of 2020, I worked as a software engineer/manager for three years at Wayfair.
I earned my bachelors in Computer Science and Africana Studies at [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu/).

I love playing Ultimate Frisbee, running, cooking, and trying different restaurants and cuisines.
