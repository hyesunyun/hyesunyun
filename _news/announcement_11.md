I attended the [CRA-WP 2023 Grad Cohort for Women Workshop](https://cra.org/cra-wp/grad-cohort-for-women/) that was held in San Francisco. I presented my in-progress research on large language models for medical systematic reviews during the poster session of the workshop. It was inspiring to meet many women grad students as well as senior women professionals in computing.
