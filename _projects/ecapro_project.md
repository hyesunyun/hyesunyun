> Our overarching aim is to adapt our prior work on ECAs to produce ECA-PRO, a framework for administering patient reported outcomes (PROs) over time using an ECA on patientsâ€™ smartphones. We seek to create the ECA-PRO system including novel user interfaces to optimally communicate PRO results to patients and clinicians using clear data visualizations. To demonstrate the generalizability of ECA-PRO, we will focus on two clinical scenarios that are very different: 1) longitudinal monitoring of symptoms and quality of life in patients undergoing cancer treatment, and 2) monitoring of medication adherence in patients taking long-term oral anti-cancer drugs. We hypothesize that the ECA-PRO system, designed for individual-patient-level interactions and data collection, will improve the reliability, validity, and overall clinical relevance of PROs collected during cancer treatment.
