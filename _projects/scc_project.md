> Culture plays an important role in health promotion interventions, and there has been an increasing use of community-based settings for health promotion activities. Church membership provides a strong foundation for social support, regular face-to-face meetings that represent additional channels for intervention, authority figures (clergy) who can be appealed to in health messaging, and a shared belief system that can be leveraged in motivating behavior change. Many churches also have a group of highly-engaged volunteers who run “Health Ministries”, responsible for promoting the health of the congregation and the broader community, and represent additional resources for health interventions.

We have partnered with local historically Black churches to design for and with our priority community an mHealth intervention application. The name of the mHealth application we developed is [Church Connect](https://www.bmatpapp.org/blog). Church Connect has a virtual agent or an embodied conversational agent named Clara who plays the role of a peer health advisor. When the app is launched for the first time, Clara introduces herself to the user and provides an overview of the features and intervention content within the app.
In the first session of the day, Clara greets the user and engages in rapport building with social chat. Then, Clara presents a list of topics that users can choose to talk about, such as exercise, nutrition, or scriptural meditation.

Clara promotes healthy eating and exercise via coaching based on the stages-of-change model as a theoretical framework. She provides goal setting and behavior logging for users in later stages of change.  Each topic has an introduction where Clara provides information on the topic at hand, for example, the current recommendations for exercise or fruit consumption, as well as getting to know the user's current engagement in these health-related behaviors.

I worked on the Bible story of the day feature as well as the notification system.

In addition, I explored how we can best index existing Bible stories to increase motivation of users towards health behavior changes. I conducted crowdsourced studies learning whether or not Bible stories or existing cultural narratives can help with increasing motivation in the health counseling context.
