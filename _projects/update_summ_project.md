With the availability of copious amounts of articles and information on one topic over time, it becomes difficult for readers to find and digest what new key information has been published. Automatic summarization has helped with distilling the important points of documents with respect to a specific information need such as a question or topic statement. We explore the task of update summarization by looking at how to generate synthesis summaries given a list of relevant articles or documents rather than just summaries of the new information. The system will take an existing summary and documents published since the summary and output an updated synthesis summary. -->
